# Exploratory Data Analysis - Bike Sharing Rental
Three months ago (**August, 2020**), I decided to start Hacktiv8’s Introduction To Python For Data Science Class Program and I’ve learned a lot since then. This course includes all the materials you need to become a Data Scientist. At the end of the program, each student is required to complete a Data Analysis or Machine Learning Project. The project I’m working on is “Data Analysis of Bike Sharing Rental”, which I basically worked on by answering a few questions below to get insights from the data.

# Outline
The bike sharing rental dataset has a total of 46,230 rows x 16 columns. Where this dataset describes the bike sharing system which is a means of renting bicycles starting from getting a membership, renting, borrowing and returning bicycles. Business processes are carried out automatically through a network of kiosk locations throughout the city. Using this system, people can rent bicycles from one location and return them to another as needed.

There are several questions I asked myself about the data, and these are five questions that I am going to answer in this article:
1. Which age group uses the Citybike rental the most and also what gender?
2. How many trips (borrowed bicycles) are there every Monday — Sunday and the hour?
3. What days have the most bicycle borrowings occurred?
4. 5 Favorite station of departure and time (hour) with your most favorite bike rental?
5. Does the age of a person affect the trip duration by the minute?

## Built With
The following are details of the programming language and libraries used in building this project: <br>
- [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/)<br>
- [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/)<br>
- [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/)<br>
- [**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)<br>
- [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/)<br>

## Process
1. Step 1: Define problem statement / data requirements specification.
2. Step 2: Data collection (including SQL connectivity using python).
3. Step 3: Data cleansing
4. Step 4: Data preprocessing
5. Step 5: Data analysis
6. Step 6: Data communication (visualize and share the results)
